      <description>Trying to craft a near-perfect bracket is difficult in itself. Attempting to build a predictive model without the nuances of human emotion for the NCAA Tournament can be an exercise in futility. But the idea is that you create a model that takes into account the factors and statistics that you you feed it, and it gives you a result that is more likely to be correct than your best guess while removing the element of human bias.</description>

      <description>Trying to craft a near-perfect bracket is difficult in itself, trying to build a predictive model without the nuances of human emotion, can be an exercise in futility. It’s difficult to establish the buy-in to throw our eye test biases out the window. You can include some metrics to account for emotions, like luck and recency bias. Even injuries can be accounted for in the most advanced models. The idea is that you build a model that takes into account the factors that best predict success , and gives you a result that is more likely than your guess of being correct.</description>

      <title>How much does recruiting impact success and vice versa in college basketball?</title>

      <description>It’s no secret that recruiting is an integral part of building a competent and competitive college basketball program. The best teams are often among the best recruiters, in theory good recruiting is rewarded with wins, and success is rewarded with signing top recruits. However, this is not always the case. There are outliers, teams that get average recruits but finish among the top teams and recruiters on the court, as well as teams that recruit better than almost anyone but underperform relative to talent.</description>

      <title>How did free throw shooting translate to team success in perhaps the most impressive free throw shooting season in college basketball history?</title>

      <description>Oral Roberts missed out on making history on March 27 in its loss to Arkansas. And no I’m not talking about becoming the first 15 seed to reach the men’s NCAA Tournament’s Elite 8. The Golden Eagles’ Cinderella run to the Sweet 16 was nothing short of spellbinding, but in the process, they missed out on toppling a 37-year old record. I’m talking about Harvard’s team free throw percentage record.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a sophomore at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln graduating in the spring of 2023 with a double-major in sports journalism and advertising &amp;amp; public relations. I made this page for a course, SPMC 350 Sports Data Analysis &amp;amp; Visualization, to host my semester projects on. I&amp;rsquo;m a sports writer for the student newspaper, the Daily Nebraskan, predominantly covering basketball and distance running. I also have an interest in sports statistics, so I am hoping this class will provide an outlet and show me how to use it.</description>
