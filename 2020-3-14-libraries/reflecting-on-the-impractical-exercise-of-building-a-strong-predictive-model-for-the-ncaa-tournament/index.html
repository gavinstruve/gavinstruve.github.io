<p>Trying to craft a near-perfect bracket is difficult in itself, trying to build a predictive model without the nuances of human emotion, can be an exercise in futility. It’s difficult to establish the buy-in to throw our eye test biases out the window. You can include some metrics to account for emotions, like luck and recency bias. Even injuries can be accounted for in the most advanced models. The idea is that you build a model that takes into account the factors that best predict success , and gives you a result that is more likely than your guess of being correct.</p>
<p>The problem is that basketball outcomes, even at the highest level, so often do not make sense. The NBA is perhaps the most difficult league to make a predictive model for given the smaller talent gap between teams and possibility of stars sitting out any given game. However, the NCAA Tournament has to be the most improbable sports playoff event in terms of outcomes, and I am hardly the first to make that assertation, it may also be the most incalculable major sporting event.</p>
<p>I took on the ill-fated endeavor of doing so along with my classmates and built a model in a relatively simple way. I had in my head that I wanted to mix simple rating system (a season-long metric that weighs average point differential with strength of schedule), kenpom’s adjusted efficiency margin (a least-squares regression )</p>
<p>Use Kentucky - UNC - KU - Duke example</p>
