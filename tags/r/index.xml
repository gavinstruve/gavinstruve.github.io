      <description>Itâ€™s no secret that recruiting is an integral part of building a competent and competitive college basketball program. The best teams are often among the best recruiters, in theory good recruiting is rewarded with wins and success is rewarded with signing top recruits. However, this is not always the case. There are outliers, teams that get average recruits but finish among the top teams and recruiters on the court, as well as teams that recruit better than almost anyone but underperform relative to talent.</description>
